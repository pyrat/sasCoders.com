Hi Michael,

I am finishing up a site that is devoted strictly to SAS jobs.  Much like dice.com, monster.com, icrunchdata.com but without all the annoying registration, badly written jobs, etc.

I was wondering if you would take a few minutes to beta test it and provide some feedback?  Specifically, I would like to make sure everything works and the "flow" of the site is intuitive.  If you could use the site as a SAS recruiter, make up a company name, make up a job advertisement, etc, that would be great.  Everything should work including purchasing credits (no $$ or credit card is actually requested for the beta).

Right now it is being hosted on a free virtual server, so the URL is a little ugly, but it will eventually be on www.sasCoders.com (which is pointing to my blog at the moment).

The site can be found at:
http://hollow-meadow-93.heroku.com

If you find anything wrong, something could look better, or something could be written better, etc, please email me.  

Thanks very much!
