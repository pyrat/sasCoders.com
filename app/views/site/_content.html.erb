What's wrong with current SAS job sites?
 * exist for the companies/recruiters
    a- poor job descriptions
        allow users to flag for poor job descriptions
    b- not location specific
        remind clients about zip of job not zip of recruiter
    c- no salary info
    d- hard to tell if recruiter/direct
        make client specify
    e- too many recruiters
       charge more for recruiters
