<p><strong>Privacy:</strong><br>
	We let you control how your contact details are shared.  Your contact details are not shared on the web unless
	you specifically put your email/phone number into the job description.  When a SAS programmer is interested in a job they email the job to themselves and receive your contact details.  That means less harvesting of your contact information by web crawlers, <strong>less spam</strong> and more contacts by people you want to talk to.
