What makes sasCoders.com different?<br>
<p>SAS Coders is different because we only post SAS job openings. Each position is carefully vetted to ensure all postings are SAS relevant, succint and accurate.</p>
<p>We never store your resume or CV.  We have no interest in "resume farming".  You don't even need to register with the site to view jobs.  Just find a SAS job you are interested in and email it to yourself to get the contact details.</p>
<p>We aim to be as straightforward and simple as possible.  No registration, no uploading resumes, no cluttered interface to distract you from your search.  Just SAS programming jobs.</p>
