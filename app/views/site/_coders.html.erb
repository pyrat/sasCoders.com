<h1>What makes sasCoders.com different?</h1><br>
<p>SAS Coders is different because we only post SAS job openings. Each position is carefully vetted to ensure all postings are SAS relevant, succinct and accurate.</p>
<p>Other sites often force you to register before getting the contact information for a job.  They want to collect your details so they can sell them.  We never store your resume or CV.  We have no interest in "resume farming".  You don't even need to register with the site to view jobs.  Just find a SAS job you are interested in and email it to yourself to get the contact details.  We don't store your email address and we will never contact you for any reason.</p>
<p>We aim to be as straightforward and simple as possible.  No registration, no uploading resumes, no cluttered interface to distract you from your search.  Just SAS programming jobs.</p>
